# Data-Cleansing-Automation-Rest-API-
This project describes an end to end automation used for building a data cleaning pipeline thorough a rest API.

Implemented end to end data cleaning automation to improve data quality
and consistency. Handled data preparation and transformation tasks using
Power Query in the Power BI, & Data Modelling (Star Schema approach).

Worked closely with the Product Management team to understand their data
pain points and reporting requirements. Translated business needs into
technical solutions, showcasing cross-functional collaboration.

Integrated Power BI with REST APIs (HTTP method) to fetch external data
sources directly into power bi for further cleaning & transformation.

‚óè Built optimized data models from scratch that support fast and scalable
features enrichment followed star schema approach, tables relationships,
and calculated columns (Age-Band, Channels, date-time fields etc.

**Result:** successfully reduced data cleansing & daily refresh time by 70%, indicating
strong skills in data cleansing & optimizing Power BI data models. Further
implemented automation for exporting cleaned data into a share-point folder
